When we think of the independent sector, we think of people and organizations outside the influence of politics and the market that offer additional and alternative services that carry our values. These values include the support of minority perspectives and needs, are fundamentally pluralistic. 

Values of civil society:
* care
* kinship
* mutualism
* justice
* speak to power
* dignity
* participiation
* pluralism
* equity

These values point towards a safer, fairer, and more just society for everyone. 

> Only civil society depends on active expression of alternatives that can act beyond motives of profit and government control... 
> it is the sector with the clearest incentive to bring these ideas to fruition and spread them as norms <br />
